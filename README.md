# Extra resources:
* If you haven't found a text editor you like, my personal favourite is Sublime.
* It's a bit terse but here is an extensive reference for JavaScript.
* Remember, Google is your friend! If you don't know something, pop a search. Stack overflow is another good place to find answers and inspiration.
